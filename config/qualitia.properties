#######################################################################################################################
#######################  THIS IS AN INTERNAL FILE REQUIRED BY QUALITIA FOR EXECUTION  #################################
############################ DO NOT REMOVE OR COMMENT ANY PROPERTIES IN THIS FILE #####################################
################## YOU CAN MAKE COPIES OF THIS AND USE IT FOR "QuailtiaOffline" executions ############################
#######################################################################################################################

### qualitia.properties or any such properties file is required by QualitiaOffline to execute tests. 
### Especially with QualitiaOffline, you can use it to create specific combinations of properties
### Though you can edit the properties in this file, it's recommended you make a copy of qualitia.properties, 
### rename it and pass it as a parameter to qualitia-Offline.xxxx.jar 
### e.g. qualitia-Offline.xxxx.jar myProperties.properties
### where xxxx is the version of the jar. Check the exact file name in the offline package
###
### Values in the qualitia.properties file will be overridden by the values in myproperties file.
### You can also provide any of the below properties as command line argument, in which case the  
### argument in the command will take precedence over the property values in the given properties file.
###
### For e.g. qualitia-Offline.xxxx.jar myProperties.properties SBrowserType=iexplore 
### In the above e.g. qualitia-Offline will launch "Internet Explorer" browser during execution overriding 
### let's say SBrowserType=firefox specified in qualitia.properties and myProperties.properties file 
### 
### Data in the properties file is provided using Name=Value format. 
### e.g. xmlPath=C:/xml 
### Here xmlPath is the name and "C:/xml" is the value. 

### For all file path values we recommend using forward slash (/) instead of backslash (\)
### If you wish to use backslash, you will need to use another "\" as this is the escape character in properties file. 
### So if you are using backslash(\) xmlPath will be xmlPath=C:\\xml 
### Please note the additional use of backslash (\) 

### qualitia.properties contains the complete list of properties supported by Qualitia
### Do not remove any properties from the below list. Removing anyone of them will result in an error.
### No other properties except the ones listed below will be processed by Qualitia. 
### So if you have any of your property names mistyped they will be ignored by Qualitia

### All file paths in the properties are relative to the working directory.
### Working directory is a folder path from where you launch qualitia-offline.xxxx.jar.
### Say for e.g. if qualitia-offline.xxxx.jar is launched from C:/myfolder/myoffline
### e.g. java -jar qualitia-offline.xxxx.jar myproperties.properties. In this case qualitia-offline will search for
### "myproperties.properties" file in "C:/myfolder/myoffline" folder

######################## Only used for Se Grid Executions #############################
### With this property, you can mention the target platform of your Grid node you wish to execute test cases on.
### So if you would like to execute your test cases on a linux node, you should specify linux here.
### e.g. linux, windows 10, win10, MAC, win7, win8, snow leopard, os x 10.6, mavericks, sierra, and so forth.
### When not specified, default value is taken as ANY, which means test cases will be executed on any available target platform.

GridPlatform=

### This feature is purely experimental. May not work in all situations
### This is to help users identify the element being acted upon and help in faster and easier issue analysis. 
### Some highlights may not be captured in snapshots due to the nature of action on the object
### For e.g. clicks on button which results in loading a page. Such a button click will not be highlighted as the page has changed
### Other situations where snapshots might not show highlight is if an action (for e.g. button click refreshes page).
### In most other cases this snapshots should show the object being acted upon.
### true to highlight HTML element during execution, false otherwise. Default is false
ExecutionHighlight=False
